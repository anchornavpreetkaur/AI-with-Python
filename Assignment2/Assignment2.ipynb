    "**1. Would you say that Deep Blue was intelligent? Explain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Blue wasn't really \"intelligent\" in the way humans are. Even though it could beat the world chess champion, it did so by quickly calculating millions of possible moves every second. It didn't actually understand the game, think creatively, or have awareness. Its \"intelligence\" was more about raw computing power than true thinking or reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What contributed to Deep Blue's success and how? Who/what should get credit for it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Blue succeeded because of its super-fast processing, smart algorithms that helped it evaluate countless chess moves quickly, and - most importantly - the IBM engineers and programmers. These humans studied Kasparov's style, improved the system, and guided it during the matches. So, the credit really goes to the team of people who built and trained Deep Blue, not the machine itself.\n"

    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What implications do you think such digital assistants will have for people?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital assistants like Google Duplex can save people a lot of time and reduce the stress of handling small everyday tasks. They can help those who struggle with phone calls—for example, people who are busy, elderly, shy, or who have language barriers or disabilities. They also make technology feel more natural by allowing people to interact with it the same way they talk to other humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What opportunities might it open for businesses?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses can benefit because customers can reach them more easily even without an online booking system. They may receive more appointments, fewer missed calls, and smoother communication. Small businesses that do not have the money or skills to build online systems can still stay accessible. It may also help reduce the workload on staff who normally answer phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Is Google Duplex narrow, general, or super AI? Explain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Duplex is a narrow AI. It is designed only for very specific tasks, such as making appointments or asking simple questions over the phone. It cannot think broadly, understand the world like humans do, or solve unrelated problems. General AI would handle many kinds of tasks like a human, and super AI would surpass human intelligence. Duplex cannot do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What impressed you most in this demo?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most impressive part is how naturally the system handled a real conversation, including pauses, unclear responses, and unexpected questions. It understood context, adjusted its answers, and sounded almost like a real person. The smoothness and realism of the interaction showed how far conversational AI has come.\n"

    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What the author has to say about the importance of the Turing test?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The author says the Turing test is deeply important because it transforms the abstract philosophical question of whether machines can think into a concrete engineering benchmark that shows how close artificial systems are to achieving genuinely human-level intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How is Turing test conducted?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Turing test is conducted by placing a human judge in a text-only conversation with two hidden participants, one human and one machine, and asking the judge to decide which one is the machine based solely on the quality of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What Turing predicted would happen by 2000? Did it happen in your opinion?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Turing predicted that by the year 2000 a machine with modest memory would fool about 30% of human judges in a five-minute conversation and that people would no longer view the idea of a “thinking machine” as contradictory. In my opinion, only the first prediction has been weakly and inconsistently achieved, while the second has clearly not come true because many people still doubt that machines can truly think.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What parts of Mitsuku's 2016 transcript resemble human conversation the most?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Mitsuku’s 2016 transcript, the most human-like aspects are its smooth conversational flow, its ability to provide context-appropriate short answers, and its attempts at casual small talk about topics like sports teams and cities, even though deeper consistency and understanding are still lacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Who was Eugene Goostman?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eugene Goostman was a chatbot that pretended to be a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy with limited English. This characterization was designed to mask its shortcomings, and it became famous in 2014 for briefly convincing a portion of judges that it was human during a Turing-test-style event.\n"
